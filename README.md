### Database-specific Instructions

Change 'user' and 'pw' in config.js to your own (probably 'root', ''?)

This component uses mariadb for a DBMS. Installing mariadb may cause conflicts with your mysql, so feel free to use mysql by following the numbered steps below. If using mariadb, skip the numbered steps.


#### TO USE MYSQL INSTEAD OF MARIADB FOLLOW THESE STEPS
- in database/index.js: change "const db = require("db/callback");" to "const db = require("mysql");"
- terminal command: npm install mysql
- terminal command: mysql -u <USER> -p < schema.sql // ----> should add the database 'reviews' to your databases

IGNORE THE REST OF THE PAGE

#### TO USE MARIADB
Please ensure that mariadb is running and execute [mysql -u <USER> -p < schema.sql] to add the database followed by [npm run seed] to seed your database
